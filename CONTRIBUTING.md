## Project Structure

Please note that this is subject to change.

- `dispatch`:
  This module handles argument parsing and environment detection. The `Opt` structure is generated by `clap`, which then generates the correct `packmanager::PackManager` trait object according to the environmental context, and then call the corresponding trait method.

    ```rust
    mod dispatch {
        #[derive(Clap)]
        struct Opt;
    }
    ```

- `error`:
  This module defines the basic error type used in this crate. `Anyhow`? It's possible! Not just yet...

    ```rust
    mod error;
    ```

- `exec`:
  This module launches subprocesses.
  
    ```rust
    mod exec {
        enum Mode {
            DryRun,
            Mute,
            ..
        }

        fn exec( .. ) -> Result< .. , error::Error>;
        ..
    }
    ```

- `packmanager`:
  Here is where the things really happen. If you want to add package manager support, please declare submodules here.

    ```rust
    mod packmanager {
        mod homebrew {
            struct Homebrew;

            impl Homebrew {
                fn suy( .. ) -> Result< .. , error::Error>;
                ..
            }
        }
        ..

        trait PackManager { .. }
    }
    ```
